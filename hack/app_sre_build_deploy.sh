### Accommodate docker or podman
#
# The docker/podman creds cache needs to be in a location unique to this
# invocation; otherwise it could collide across jenkins jobs. We'll use
# a .docker folder relative to pwd (the repo root).

mkdir -p ${CONTAINER_ENGINE_CONFIG_DIR}
# But docker and podman use different options to configure it :eyeroll:
# ==> Podman uses --authfile=PATH *after* the `login` subcommand; but
# also accepts REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE from the env. See
# https://www.mankier.com/1/podman-login#Options---authfile=path
export REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=${CONTAINER_ENGINE_CONFIG_DIR}/config.json
# ==> Docker uses --config=PATH *before* (any) subcommand; so we'll glue
# that to the CONTAINER_ENGINE variable itself. (NOTE: I tried half a
# dozen other ways to do this. This was the least ugly one that actually
# works.)
